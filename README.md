# Ceecee

Ceecee is an app to gather information on your customer's customers. Hence the
name.

## Running

To run the application, first run `make build` to install the needed
requirements, then you can run it with `make run`.

The result will be output to `data` directory.

## Possible improvements

* Make sure the company name is correct and properly capitalized.
* Extend the parsing to companies from other subpages like https://scale.com/customers
  and https://www.deel.com/case-studies.
